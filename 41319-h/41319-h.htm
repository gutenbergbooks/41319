How to Awaken and Direct It</b></p>


<p>In theoretical as well as applied psychology
no term is more misleading, or confusing than
the term consciousness. We use the term often
in our conversation; we come across it in our
study; but when we are asked to define it properly,
to explain its significance, its meaning,
or the idea for which that word stands, we are
unable to do so. And that is because there are
so many varied ideas concerning consciousness.
There are so many aspects of consciousness,
there are so many states of consciousness that
we get mixed up&mdash;that is, we confuse one with
the other. So we must know thoroughly the
true significance of the term. Then we can
make such distinctions as inner consciousness
and outer consciousness.</p>

<p>What is truly meant by consciousness, or
what is the principle back of that term? There
are many ideas which cannot be expressed properly
for lack of words, or lack of terms. The
word consciousness is really derived from the
Latin root <b>scio</b>, to know, and <b>con</b>, together; so
the word consciousness from the derivative
meaning would signify: to know together.<span class='pagenum'>[4]</span>
We use the term generally in the sense of being
conscious of a fact. That is, consciousness
means knowing an object, as it were; knowing
something. But the word consciousness really
indicates two things&mdash;subject and object. It
implies the duality of existence. There is one
who is the knower, the subject, the ego, the
perceiver. I know it; I am conscious of it; I
perceive it; I think about it. Therefore there
is always the subject, the ego&mdash;I&mdash;as the background
of any form of consciousness.</p>

<p>Then there must be something to be conscious
of, something which we perceive, something
which we know, something which we understand,
and that something is the object. So,
&ldquo;knowing together&rdquo; means we know the subject
and object together&mdash;that is, they both
exist; one cannot exist without the other. So
wherever there is a subject, there is also an object.
That means that wherever there is a
thinker, there must be something to think
about; otherwise there is no meaning back of
the term &ldquo;thinker&rdquo;. Whenever we use the
term &ldquo;perceiver&rdquo;, we must know that there is
something to be perceived. The same is true
of consciousness. Whenever we use the term
&ldquo;consciousness&rdquo;, we must know it includes
both&mdash;the one who is conscious of something,
and something of which that one is conscious.<span class='pagenum'>[5]</span>
Therefore the word &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; implies
duality.</p>

<p>There is another meaning back of &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo;
which we often fail to understand, or
about which we do not stop to think deeply.
That is why we miss it. Consciousness not only
implies the idea of becoming conscious of a
thing, or the state of being conscious of something,
but there is also the idea of identification
back of it.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of identification? By
identification we mean a state in which we become
almost one with a thing. When we become
one with a thing we become conscious of
it. Of course ordinarily we may not be wholly
identified with it, but the word consciousness
indicates that, and judging our modes of
thought, or observing the practical phases of
our life, we shall see that there is identification.</p>

<p>Take for instance, the word &ldquo;body-consciousness&rdquo;.
What does it mean? It means that not
only are we conscious of the body, but we are
also identified with it. I can not separate myself
from the body; I am almost one with it. I
have become mixed up, as it were, with the
body and its conditions. There the subject or
ego is hidden; only the object of consciousness,
the object of perception is there. So that is
another meaning of consciousness.<span class='pagenum'>[6]</span></p>

<p>The deepest and purest meaning of consciousness
is this: the absolute consciousness. There
is the Sanskrit word &ldquo;chit&rdquo;. You will come
across that word in the study of the Upanishads,
in the Vedas, in the Gita, and in many
such books. You will find not only ancient
sages, but the sages of modern times have
been using the term &ldquo;Sat-chit-ananda&rdquo;, meaning
the Divine Spirit. Sat-chit-ananda&mdash;what
is its meaning? It means absolute existence,
absolute consciousness, absolute bliss. These
three are not the qualities of the Divine Spirit,
but they are the essence&mdash;one with it. So chit
is the word of pure consciousness. In the understanding
of pure consciousness, we have to
eliminate the duality of existence, the duality
of subject and object. It stands alone; it is
that of which the subject and object are lower
manifestations, or expressions. It is that
which makes everything possible, which gives
life and soul to the subject and object, as it
were. So that is pure consciousness, the basic,
the fundamental, the principle back of everything
that is indicated by pure consciousness.</p>

<p>There is a beautiful Sanskrit verse which expresses
this idea.</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Na Tatra Suryo bhati na chandra tarakam<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[7]</span>Nema Vidyuto bhanti Kutoyam agni<br />
Tameva bhantam anubhati sarvam<br />
Tasya bhasha Sarvamidam bibhati&rdquo; (Kathopanishad, Chap. V. 15).<br />
</p>

<p>In describing the pure, the basic, fundamental
principle of life and creation&mdash;the pure
light, the self-effulgent, self-caused Divine Intelligence&mdash;Vedic
sages sang in this way: &ldquo;There the sun does not shine, nor the moon,
nor the lightning, what to speak of the mortal
fire. That shining, everything shines; by its
light everything is illumined&rdquo;,&mdash;by its essence
everything becomes full of consciousness.</p>

<p>There is another Sanskrit word which expresses
the same idea, Kaivalyam, the state of
being alone; that which is self-caused; that
which is not dependent on anything; that which
is freedom itself; which is above everything.
Do you see? There all differentiation vanishes&mdash;differentiation
of subject and object, I and
thou. All these ideas are merged, as it were, in
that absolute consciousness. So the pure consciousness
is that.</p>

<p>However, when we apply the term consciousness
in our daily lives, in its varied relation to
various channels of existence, in our varied experiences,
in different states and conditions,
we have to understand it from a dualistic
standpoint, and we also have to study other<span class='pagenum'>[8]</span>
phases of consciousness, such as inner consciousness
and outer consciousness, soul-consciousness
and body consciousness. All these terms
we bring in to explain the different details, or
the different stages of development, or the different
stages of experience through which we
have to pass.</p>

<p>In order to be able to understand the inner
consciousness, we must know it in its relation
to the outer consciousness. The light can be
understood only in its relation to darkness.
Praise can be understood only in its relation
to blame. Joy can be understood only in its relation
to suffering or pain. One who is not
really hungry cannot really appreciate the
value of food. So, many ideas exist only relatively.
It is the same with the inner and outer
consciousness. We must understand both&mdash;then
both become clear. What is meant then
by outer consciousness? Outer consciousness
means consciousness in which we are cognizant
of external things&mdash;gross forms, gross objects,
sense objects. Now, every moment of our lives,
the senses bring in these impressions. The
senses come in touch with the external objects
of nature, gross things, gross objects, objects
of vision, objects of touch, objects of taste. All
these objects of perception exist in gross form,
and there is the impression within ourselves, or<span class='pagenum'>[9]</span>
there are impressions of varied sorts. That is
outer consciousness&mdash;consciousness of the outer-world,
the objective world.</p>

<p>I am not going to enter here into a detailed
exposition of what is called idealism, or realism.
But outer consciousness must mean this to us:
there is the idea of objective perception, and
there is the objective world. We know that
there is external nature, and all the time we
are impressed with this idea. So when we cannot
extricate ourselves from the realm and domain
of forms and objects, when we cannot rise
above the sense perceptions&mdash;the gross sense
perceptions&mdash;when we cannot divest our minds
of these externalities, as it were, then you will
understand this state to be the outer consciousness.</p>

<p>Coming nearer the practical idea&mdash;there is
the body-consciousness. As I stated previously,
that means that we are conscious of the
body, the body in all its phases, in all its senses,
and in all its aspects.</p>

<p>Then there is a consciousness within ourselves.
You may say that only through mind
can we understand this, only through thought
processes can we get knowledge of external
nature. That is true, but in order to explain
the inner consciousness properly, I have to
bring in this idea of the outer consciousness<span class='pagenum'>[10]</span>
where all these things exist; where there are
nothing but external things, nothing but sense
impressions, nothing but outer objects and their
impressions.</p>

<p>What is meant by inner consciousness? Inner
consciousness means: consciousness of inner
forces, consciousness of inner perceptions, consciousness
of what is called soul energy, consciousness
of the Divine in the soul. That is a
consciousness of something distinct and separate
from the sense impressions, from bodily
conditions, from external gross objects, from
external perceptions.</p>

<p>Now this question may arise in your mind:
Why should we try to awaken our inner consciousness?
What benefit do we gain by it?
We always ask that question. What are we
going to gain by it? Why should we try to
arouse the inner consciousness, if the outer
consciousness is as explained? What harm is
there in living in the outer consciousness only?
Our life means that, our life means the varied
duties of life&mdash;the varied responsibilities. Our
life means its relation to our fellow-beings, to
the world, to so many material things, to so
many objects, to so many phases of external
life. Our life means all this&mdash;and what is the
harm in living in that state of consciousness?
Why should we try to awaken our inner con<span class='pagenum'>[11]</span>sciousness?
Is there any necessity for it? Is
it absolutely necessary&mdash;is it indispensably necessary
to enter that life? Yes, it is absolutely
necessary for persons in all walks of life.
Why? Because while living in the outer consciousness
we are not really contented. We
always complain, either openly or mentally.
Something is always lacking in our life. Just
ask yourself this question: Are we really
happy? It is not that we have to give up our
external life, our material life. It is not that
we have to eliminate all these things completely
from our life. No. But we have to know
where we stand, and we have to understand the
purpose and the meaning of our external life,
or outer consciousness. We must know why
we have to go through life&rsquo;s duties. We must
know why we have to perform so many activities.
What is the purpose? What is the idea
back of it? Why are those condemned who
neglect their duties, who shirk their responsibilities,
who do not try to perform their
functions, their duties properly? The idea is
this: First of all, we are ignorant of the
meaning and purpose of life. We cannot explain
definitely the reason for all these activities.
We do not know why we live in the midst
of sense perceptions. Why are we experiencing
these things? We have certain desires, we<span class='pagenum'>[12]</span>
have certain tendencies, certain emotions, certain
passions. We are regulated by them; we
are carried away by them against our will.
We are, as it were, enslaved by certain things,
and we go on, not knowing whence we have
come or whither we are going, or what is the
mission of our life. That is why the question
was asked in ancient times by the Vedic sages:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that, knowing which, everything
else will be known?&rdquo; What is that fountainhead,
knowing which, we shall understand the
meaning and purpose of life&mdash;knowing which,
everything would be explained? Everything
appears to be detached, purposeless, meaningless.
What is that, knowing which, everything
would be illumined? That is the question.
That is the desire, in reality, in every human
heart. We may not be able to explain it; we
may not know it properly at times; but it is
there, and only the sages have put the question
definitely. That is why we must try to get into
that realm of pure consciousness, as I explained.
There are different grades of inner
consciousness. The deeper we search, the
more we understand, the more will that pure
consciousness be unfolded which alone holds
the key. To illuminate, to unfold, to explain
everything in our life, we must come to that.</p>

<p>There is another reason why we must try to<span class='pagenum'>[13]</span>
go beyond the outer and enter into the inner
consciousness, and that is this: There is always
reaction in our life&mdash;that is, when we live
in the external consciousness, there is always
reaction. Suffering is caused by reaction. Our
miseries, our pains, our complaints, our doubts,
our troubles, our disillusionments, our despair,
have always been caused by the outer consciousness.
For instance, when we live in the
midst of sense perceptions we want to possess
certain objects which we have perceived, impressions
of which have been gathered through
the senses. First of all, the senses come in
touch with external things. It may be a little
food, a little form; it may be a little object;
but it is there. That impression gets hold of
us, and what do we want to do? We want to
get that object; we want to possess it; we want
to own it. When we cannot own it, there is
suffering, there is heart-burning.</p>

<p>Suppose I love some object. I try my best
to possess it. I cannot do it. Something
stands in the way and takes it away from me&mdash;snatches
it away. There is suffering. There is
misery. In this way we are constantly becoming
dependent on external things. These outer
things, these external things, these objects of
the senses get hold of us. They enter our lives
and completely hold sway over us, and we are<span class='pagenum'>[14]</span>
carried away by them. Then we are thrown
back, as it were, into ourselves; because nature&rsquo;s
laws work relentlessly&mdash;and there are
changes&mdash;there are separations.</p>

<p>You may say such ideas bring gloominess,
pessimism into our lives. What difference does
it make if we become a little gloomy, or if
we become pessimistic? What has your optimism
given us? What do the passing joys
bring us? They bring us nothing but reaction.
So-called optimism does not land us anywhere.
It rather leads us into complex situations and
conditions. Rather we should hail with joy
that sort of pessimism, true pessimism, which
brings us face to face with the truth, which
enables us to see things in their true color. Yes,
we must face things boldly. It is not simply by
patchwork that we gain in life, it is only by
bold search and uncompromising investigation.
It is by going to the root and the bottom of
things that we gain&mdash;truly gain&mdash;and accomplish
something which is worth achieving. So
we must not be afraid of analysing things in a
deeper way. You see around you nature&rsquo;s
changes and separations. You love a person.
That person dies, or is taken away to other
lands. You are miserable and prostrated with
grief. Again, you have possessed certain
things and you lose them&mdash;you lose a fortune<span class='pagenum'>[15]</span>
in a few days, or in a few weeks, or in a few
months. You are overcome with sorrow. That
is life, and that is what is meant by outer consciousness.
It is not that you must not have
possessions; it is not that you must not have
good homes; it is not that you must not love
others. But do it knowingly; do it not as a
slave, but as a master; not as a dependent
worm, but as the witness you should approach
these things.</p>

<p>Many things there are which must be taken
into our lives necessarily. Unhappily we delude
ourselves; we forget ourselves; we lose
our heads; we lose our judgment; and we are
carried away by the currents of life, not knowing
whither we are going. When we are caught
up in the whirl of conditions, when we are lost
in the labyrinthian maze of circumstances,
then we wake up for a while. Again we forget.
So that is the outer consciousness, which has
separations everywhere. You cannot depend
upon anything. As soon as you depend upon
anything&mdash;lean on anything&mdash;it is taken away
from you, and what is to be done? That is
why we must try to search for something which
is more internal, which is not so changeable,
on whom, or on which you can depend to a
greater extent, because everything is relative
until we get to the Absolute. We must find<span class='pagenum'>[16]</span>
something which is better, which is greater.
And that is our search&mdash;that should be our
search. So, while living a life of outer consciousness
you will analyse and you will see
how all your complex conditions regarding
which you complain, all the entanglements
which we notice in different lives, all the confusion
and friction which we see at home or
abroad, all the heart-burnings, disillusionment
and suffering which we notice amongst individuals&mdash;all
these can be traced to that outer
consciousness, that slavery, that dependence
upon the material things of life. That is why
we have to open up our inner consciousness.
That is why we want to know if there is anything
beyond the veil of the senses. That is
why we must know whether there is anything
back of this changeable condition of the senses
and this changeable condition of the body.</p>

<p>Now, you may ask the question, how do we
know that there is such a thing as soul-energy,
or that there are inner forces? How do we
know? We know as we know everything in
life. We have to follow the same methods.
How do you know the different details of a
machine? You study that machine. You follow
three processes&mdash;that is, three steps you
must take in everything. First of all, you
get hold of a book, or you go to a person who<span class='pagenum'>[17]</span>
knows about the machine and you ask him
questions. You look over different descriptions
of the details of the machine, then you
think for yourself; you judge for yourself.
You revolve all these details within your mind.
You analyse, and gradually you begin to handle
the machine yourself&mdash;practical experience
you must acquire.</p>

<p>For instance, if you want to know about
electricity, what do you do? You get hold of
a book on the subject of electricity. Then you
go to a professor and receive instruction. Then
you go to the laboratory and handle different
machines and study them.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to learn music, you follow
the same process. And it is the same with
this subject of the inner consciousness. First
of all, you have to study; you must read books,
or you must consult some persons who know.
Would you believe blindly? Would you accept
blindly that which they tell you? No.
In no study must we accept anything blindly.
Blind belief does not lead us anywhere. We
must search thoroughly without any fear.
Truth can stand all the tests of analysis, all
the tests of observation. And if it is not truth,
it can not stand the test. So always keep the
reasoning faculty, or power of analysis sharpened,
ready to observe, ready to understand,<span class='pagenum'>[18]</span>
ready to reason out. At every point you must
reason. And the more is this true with regard
to the study of these inner things. Why? Because
there are so many dangers and difficulties
in studying these inner things. Many
promising lives have been failures owing to a
lack of proper understanding, owing to ignorance,
owing to indiscriminate search or indiscriminate
investigation. You cannot be too
cautious&mdash;you cannot be too careful in studying
these things.</p>

<p>These, then, are the steps you have to take.
First, study and go to a person who has
studied these things and who knows these
things. In every book you will notice you are
asked to go to a teacher. As you need a teacher
in different fields of knowledge, so you need
a teacher in this field too, and the more so because
the objects which you are going to learn,
the principles which you are going to master,
are so subtle. Machines you can handle properly,
because they are external things. You
can grasp them. You can see them. But in
studying this subject you have to study that
which is very subtle, which is very fine. That
is why you need more care. You need the
help, you need the guidance of some one who
is an expert teacher. And then you analyse
yourself and reason&mdash;always reason. But do<span class='pagenum'>[19]</span>
not bring that sort of skepticism into your life
which is dangerous, which, as it were, clogs
up all the channels of experience, which covers,
or shuts up, all the avenues of knowledge,
which makes one give up the search without
proper study and investigation. Do not become
skeptical in that way. Many have a tendency
to become skeptical and give up the
search. We have no honest right to demand
any knowledge unless we have studied properly,
or investigated closely. So open your
mind, your heart, your soul to conviction. At
the same time, do not take anything for granted,
but be ready to learn. Always be receptive,
always be responsive. Then we have to
apply certain direct means; we have to follow
certain practical methods in order to accomplish
our purpose.</p>

<p>Now, of all the different methods which are
handed down to us from the great sages and
masters, one method is important, and that is
concentration. Why is concentration upheld
as a great method? Can we not awaken the
inner consciousness by prayer, by worship, by
devotion, by Divine love, and in many other
ways? Certainly, we can. But in the path of
concentration we can rise step by step&mdash;it is
the most scientific method. Of course every
path can be made scientific we may say, or<span class='pagenum'>[20]</span>
every path can be followed step by step. True.
But we can combine certain methods. Take,
for instance, devotion. Devotion is a great
thing. The love for an ideal, we need; it is important;
in this country it is necessary. But
if we allow ourselves to be carried away by
heightened emotions, or by wrought-up feelings,
we may develop fanaticism. There have
been instances in which devotion, love, Divine
love&mdash;when not combined with proper concentration,
or proper analysis&mdash;have landed persons
in the realm of emotionalism, or sentimentality,
or fanaticism. They are led into the
realm of bigotry and narrowness and carried
away by these things. So try to balance devotion,
with proper reasoning and it will be a
great, helpful method. True prayer can open
up our inner communion and help us to unfold.
Pure self-analysis is another method. But concentration
has been found to be very helpful
for many, many people&mdash;for the majority of
people&mdash;if it can be followed under the guidance
of proper teachers and if it can be followed
methodically. But some might say that
there is danger in concentration. There is no
danger in concentration. Consciously or unconsciously
we apply it in every field of knowledge.
Without concentration what can you
do? As Emerson said, &ldquo;The one prudence in<span class='pagenum'>[21]</span>
life is concentration; the one evil is dissipation.&rdquo;
In war, in politics, in business, in trade,
in the management of all commercial and social
affairs, concentration is the secret of success.</p>

<p>And what is meant by concentration? Concentration
includes two things. One is gathering
up scattered energies; another is focussing
these scattered energies of mind.</p>

<p>As I explained, outer consciousness means
this: We are dependent on the senses and outward
things. That is, when we try to think
of inner things, we are held back by our dependence
on things external. We are all the
time living in these external impressions, and
cannot enter into the inner realm of understanding.</p>

<p>And how does concentration help us? Concentration
helps us to withdraw our scattered
minds from different directions. The mind has
been scattered. It wanders among various
objects, which are impressions in our minds.
The mind has been divided, and thus mental
energy is dissipated. Very little energy is left
for the accomplishment of the real ideals in
life. But gradually we learn by concentration
how to withdraw the scattered forces of the
mind and how to focus them upon the chosen
ideal.<span class='pagenum'>[22]</span></p>

<p>There are many details, but I am only mentioning
the most important points.</p>

<p>When, through proper training and daily
practice, one is able to learn how to gather up
the wandering mind, and withdraw these different
powers of the mind from different
sources and focus them on one thing, then so
much energy has been combined, as it were, and
we can accomplish something. Otherwise, so
much of our energy has been dissipated.</p>

<p>Regarding the difficulties and dangers of concentration,
let me mention that there are difficulties
in all paths, in all fields of knowledge.
Nothing worth achieving has been accomplished
without a little difficulty, without a little sacrifice,
without a little sincere and earnest effort.
You know, curiosity-seekers never reach anything
in life. Those who are sincere and earnest
searchers and seekers have gradually unfolded
themselves and reached the higher
realms of understanding. So there is no real
danger in concentration. We must start with
that idea, and not be hasty. Many of us try to
take things like a pill. We take a pill, and it
must accomplish its results. Concentration is
not a pill&mdash;and we do not know what accumulated
experiences and impressions are at our
backs. Through different lives and through
the present life we have been gathering up so<span class='pagenum'>[23]</span>
many things. We are performing so many
karmas, as we say, and we have to eliminate so
many things in our lives. Through proper effort
we shall remove many obstacles, many difficulties,
and our task will become easier and
easier.</p>

<p>Now, the Yogis, in figurative language call
this opening up of the inner consciousness the
awakening of the Kundalini. You will see&mdash;if
you analyse your life&mdash;that there are a few
things which are constantly holding your attention.
The mind, as it were, is drawn into
certain realms. As I explained in the beginning,
sense perceptions are in different forms
and include many things&mdash;our eating, our
drinking, all sorts of habits and many other
things. Thus the best of our energies are swallowed
up, as it were, by these things. The
Yogis claim that the nerve centers&mdash;the lower
nerve centers&mdash;have absorbed these energies
and the energies are chained there, or enslaved
there, and you have to release them. There
are two sides, the physiological and mental.
Physiologically, when we begin to practise concentration,
this energy is gradually released
from the lower centers. It is called the awakening
of Kundalini&mdash;coiled-up energy&mdash;energy
in latent form or enslaved form. Simultan<span class='pagenum'>[24]</span>eously
our mind is released from its impressions
and begins to work in a higher realm.</p>

<p>Time will not permit me to enter into the details
of this subject, but I just want to touch
upon some important points, so that you will
think and study and investigate more.</p>

<p>A few points I must try to impress upon your
mind. I must repeat that first of all these
things should be studied under the guidance of
proper teachers, and secondly, that you need
not believe anything blindly. I want to impress
this upon your mind because these things are
established facts and those who have experienced
them know these things. They are not
the results of mere speculation, or mere imagination,
because those teachers who would try
to teach you will tell you from the beginning
that you have to eliminate all the ideas of
imagination. You must give up imagining
things. Many of us have a tendency to imagine
too much, constantly seeing visions and
other things. You must eliminate those notions
from the beginning, and must try to live in
realities, in facts and true experiences. So you
must not accept anything credulously, but try
to study and investigate for yourself.</p>

<p>The Yogis declare that there is a hollow
canal in the spinal column, and that the base of
the spinal column, in the majority of persons, is<span class='pagenum'>[25]</span>
closed. When these energies are released, they
must find a passage and they must be allowed
to go through this canal, and as this released
energy rises into higher and higher centers, we
enter into inner and inner stages of illumination.
And when that energy reaches the brain&mdash;the
highest center, the pineal gland&mdash;there
the illumination becomes absolute; that is, we
reach that pure state of consciousness of which
I have spoken.</p>

<p>You will find as you progress that there are
physiological experiences and mental experiences.
As we have physiological experiences
we shall see that the whole nervous system is
changing. Our bodies are full of vibrating currents.
Our whole life is full of vibrating currents,
and we must know how to direct them,
how to adjust them. And that is why I said
the teachers would ask you to give up that
idea of imagining things. We imagine and
speculate too much. We must not accept anything
unless it is realized, and that is why the
student must be properly directed.</p>

<p>And why is it necessary that the student
should be directed? Because of ignorance of
the subtle forces involved. As these physiological
experiences go on, layer after layer of
the mind is opened up, but you must let these
experiences alone. You must not identify your<span class='pagenum'>[26]</span>self
with them. Do you not see that in order
to eliminate these external conditions and enter
into the inner realms of consciousness, we have
to rise above the body consciousness? Therefore,
if we identify ourselves with these vibrations,
or any kind of physiological experiences,
we are going against what we are trying to accomplish.
We would be inconsistent. So put
the chemicals together and let the crystallization
take care of itself. Gradually the latent
energy awakens, and the energy working in
the life is concentrated. Gradually you will
see a new vista of knowledge and wisdom opening
before you. A new land, a new realm of
experience is coming to you, and that needs the
master mind. Instead of allowing ourselves to
become enslaved again by these conditions, we
must rise above them as the master. We must
become the director. Instead of allowing the
mind to take the reins, we must take the reins
in our own hands. You, as part of the Divine
Spirit, have that mastery and power. You
have that strength within you, and you are going
to be the director. And so you have to tell
the mind and the senses and the little things in
your life that you are the master. They must
know who is the master, and who is going to
direct the situation. In this way we have to
direct properly, knowing the ideal thoroughly,<span class='pagenum'>[27]</span>
knowing where we are going, what we are trying
to accomplish, eliminating all the selfish
ideals, eliminating all the obstacles and difficulties
as much as possible.</p>

<p>Yes, there are obstacles; there are difficulties,
and we are frightened by them. But you must
remember these difficulties and obstacles can
be overcome. They come to test our strength,
and we overcome them, we unfold our latent
and dormant powers. So never give way.
Never give up after you accept a method. Be
not hasty in adopting a method, but once you
have taken it up, follow it with the utmost pertinacity.
Follow it with that sincerity and
earnestness of purpose necessary for accomplishment
in all walks of life and in all fields
of achievement. And then go on, day after
day, practising it, following it with un-ending
patience and perseverance.</p>

<p>Gradually a time will come when you will
see that there is a realm, or there are different
realms of inner consciousness which are being
unfolded to you. By degrees you will come to
that state of Divine illumination which will
make you really blessed. The blessedness of
that state cannot be described&mdash;it must be felt&mdash;it
must be experienced.</p>

<p>I will conclude this topic with the admonition
that we must be absolutely sincere, and<span class='pagenum'>[28]</span>
we must not apply these things in any other
way than for spiritual unfoldment. There is
the danger. We have a tendency to apply
them in different realms&mdash;lower states&mdash;and for
selfish purposes. We must avoid that. To
many, you must remember, it may be a life
task. For many, it may take several lives.
Some may accomplish it in a few years. To
others, again&mdash;persons of sincerity and steadfastness&mdash;it
may come quickly. But whatever
time it takes, we must be determined and we
must start with this idea, that even before passing
away from this life, we will reach a very
high state of consciousness, and we will unfold
that Divine, cosmic, universal, absolute
consciousness, which alone can make us really
happy and blessed.</p>
